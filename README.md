# Libft
Libft is a library of functions created as part of the School 42 curriculum.
It contains a collection of standard C language functions that can be used in different projects.

#Content
The Libft library is divided into several files and folders:

libft.h: The header file containing function prototypes and structure definitions used in the library.
libft.a: The compiled static library containing all libft functions.
Makefile: The configuration file used to compile the library and associated programs.
Compilation
To compile the Libft library, just run the make command at the root of the project. This will generate the libft.a file.

Once compiled, you can use the library by including it in your C projects and adding the -L /path/to/libft compiler option to link the library to your program.

# Use
The Libft library provides a wide range of functions divided into different categories:

String manipulation functions (ft_strlen, ft_strcpy, etc.).
Memory manipulation functions (ft_memset, ft_memcpy, etc.).
Type conversion functions (ft_atoi, ft_itoa, etc.).
And many others...
See the libft.h header file for a full list of available functions along with their description and usage.
